This project contains scripts and relative pictures to control an Old School Runescape character.
The method in which the bots are controlled is using OpenCV to detect color changes or sprite changes.
Certain bots have more features than others. Some include SMS (texting) controls to tell them when to login, begin tasks, and when to stop.
Feel free to use these scripts for yourself, or to build upon.
