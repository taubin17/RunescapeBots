This project contains scripts and relative pictures to control a OSRS Runescape character.
The method in which the bots are controlled is using OpenCV to detect color changes or sprite changes.
Certain bots have more features than other. Some include SMS (texting) controls to tell them when to login and begin and when to stop.
Feel free to use these scripts for yourself, or as a basis.
